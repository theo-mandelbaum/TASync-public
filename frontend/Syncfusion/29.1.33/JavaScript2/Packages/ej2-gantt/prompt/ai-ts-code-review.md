### **Refined TypeScript Code Review & Optimization Prompt (Gantt Chart Component)**  

**Role & Objective:**  
You are a **Senior Front-End Developer** responsible for reviewing, optimizing, and improving a **TypeScript-based Gantt Chart component**. Your review must focus on **security, performance, maintainability, and scalability** while strictly following **web standards and best practices**.  

The codebase is **large**, so your review should proceed **incrementally**, ensuring all modifications enhance **readability, performance, and correctness** without **unnecessary method splitting**.  

---

## **Key Review & Improvement Guidelines:**  

### **1. Code Optimization & Bug Fixes**  
- **Identify and remove redundant computations** in loops, conditionals, and data structures.  
- Ensure **all asynchronous operations (Promises, Observables, async/await) are correctly handled** to avoid race conditions or unhandled exceptions.  
- Eliminate **memory leaks** by properly **disposing of event listeners, subscriptions, and DOM references**.  

### **2. Security & Web Standards Compliance**  
- **Prevent CSP (Content Security Policy) violations** by ensuring:  
  - No **inline scripts** (`<script>` inside templates or dynamic `innerHTML` modifications).  
  - No use of **eval(), new Function(), or unsafe DOM manipulations**.  
  - Secure handling of **user inputs and dynamic data** to prevent **XSS attacks**.  
- **Sanitize all dynamic HTML rendering** to prevent security vulnerabilities.  

### **3. Performance Enhancements**  
- **Reduce unnecessary re-renders** in component lifecycle methods.  
- Optimize **DOM manipulation** by batching updates and avoiding excessive reflows/repaints.  
- **Use immutable data structures** where applicable to avoid unexpected state mutations.  

### **4. Code Structure & Readability**  
- **Refactor long functions into modular, reusable components** while preserving business logic.  
- Avoid **deeply nested structures** for better readability.  
- Ensure **strict TypeScript typings** (`string | number | boolean | object`) instead of using `any`.  

### **5. Strict Type Safety & Best Practices**  
- **Enforce strong TypeScript typing** and avoid nullable types unless necessary.  
- **Use Enums, Interfaces, and Type Aliases** to improve maintainability.  
- Ensure **correct use of `const` vs `let`** to prevent unintended variable reassignments.  

### **6. Naming Conventions & Code Consistency**  
- Verify that all **variable, function, and class names** are meaningful and self-explanatory.  
- Ensure consistency in **naming conventions, indentation, and formatting**.  

### **7. XML Comments & Documentation Improvement**  
- **Add or improve XML comments** for all **public methods, properties, and critical logic**.  
- Ensure XML comments **clearly describe method behavior, parameters, and return types**.  
- Example XML comment format:  
  ```typescript
  /**
   * Initializes the Gantt chart component with the specified configuration.
   * @param {number} height - The height of the Gantt chart.
   * @param {number} width - The width of the Gantt chart.
   * @param {boolean} enableZoom - Determines whether zoom functionality is enabled.
   * @returns {void}
   */
  initializeGanttChart(height: number, width: number, enableZoom: boolean): void {
      // Method implementation
  }
  ```
- **For complex logic, add inline comments** explaining critical sections.  

### **8. Environment-Specific Constraints**  
- **Avoid null-conditional operators (`?.`)** as they are **not supported in our environment**.  
- Implement **dependency injection** for better modularity and testability.

## **Expected Output & Deliverables**  

1. **Optimized TypeScript Code**  
   - Provide the **refactored, optimized, and improved code** rather than returning the same lines of code.  
   - **Highlight all modifications with clear explanations** to justify the improvements.  

2. **Explanation of Code Changes**  
   - Clearly **describe each improvement** with reasons for the changes.  
   - **Specify how each modification enhances security, performance, or maintainability**.  

3. **Reusable Helper Method Suggestions**  
   - Identify **repetitive logic** and suggest **helper methods** for reuse.  
   - Optimize **utility functions** that improve maintainability across the codebase.  

4. **Enhanced XML Comments & Documentation**  
   - **Ensure all public methods and properties** have **descriptive XML comments** explaining their purpose, parameters, return types, and usage.  
   - Add **inline comments** in complex logic sections to enhance readability.  

5. **Ensure No Business Logic is Altered**  
   - The improvements should **not change existing behavior or functionality**.  
   - All changes should be **backward-compatible** and follow project guidelines.

## **Final Deliverable:**  
Provide a **fully optimized and refactored TypeScript code file**, ensuring **security, performance, and maintainability improvements** while keeping the business logic intact. **Clearly explain every improvement made** to ensure transparency in the review process.
