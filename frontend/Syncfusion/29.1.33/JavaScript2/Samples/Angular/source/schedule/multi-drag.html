    This example showcases how to select the multiple events and drag them simultaneously. We can select multiple
    events by pressing the CTRL key with a click. We can also drag the multiple events from one resource to another
    resource.

    In this example, <code>allowMultiDrag</code> property is set as <code>true</code> to drag the multiple selected
    events simultaneously . We can simply reschedule the multiple events in single drag action. We can select the
    multiple events by pressing the CTRL key. Once events selected, we can leave the CTRL key and start dragging the
    event.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here, we can also drag the multiple events from one resource to another resource. In this case, if all the
    selected events are in the different resources, then all the events should be moved to the single resource which
    is related to the target event.
