<div id="description">
    <p>
        In this example, you can see how to render a Gantt chart with critical path. The default timeline
        view week-day mode is applied to Gantt chart. The dependency lines are enabled in this example to represent the
        execution order or the hierarchy between the phases.
    </p>
    <p>
        The critical path is a series of tasks (or sometimes only a single task) that controls the calculated finish date of the project. 
        If a task in a critical path is delayed, then the entire project will be delayed.
    </p>
    <p style="font-weight: 500">Injecting Module:</p>
    <p>
        Gantt control features are segregated into individual feature-wise modules. To use a critical path, inject the
        <code>CriticalPath</code> module using the <code>Gantt.Inject(CriticalPath)</code> method.
    </p>
    <p>More information on the Critical Path feature can be found in this
