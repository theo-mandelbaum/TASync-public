        This sample showcases an inversed spline chart depicting stock market capitalization as a percentage of GDP by country, with enhanced interactivity through markers and tooltips.

    <p>
        In this example, you can see how to render and configure inversed spline type charts using the
        <code>isTransposed</code> property. A spline chart uses a curved line to connect points in a data series.
        <code>Markers</code> are used to represent individual data points and their values.
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>Tooltips</code> are enabled in this example. To see a tooltip in action, hover over or tap on the chart.

    <p style="font-weight: 500"><b>Injecting Module</b></p>
    <p>
        Chart component features are segregated into individual feature-wise modules. To use spline series, we need to
        inject
        <code>SplineSeries</code> module using <code>Chart.Inject(SplineSeries)</code> method.
    </p>
