        This sample visualizes the almond yield per hectare data for different countries using a spline series in the chart. 
        The data points are enhanced with tooltip and the animation delay is configured to provide a smooth, staggered effect.

        In this example, you can see how to render and configure a spline chart with multiple series representing almond
        yield across different countries over time. Spline charts are ideal for visualizing smooth trends in data over equal
        intervals, particularly time-dependent data.
        The <code>width</code> and <code>animation</code> properties are used to customize the appearance and behavior of
        the spline. The staggered animations enhance the visual experience by introducing each spline in sequence.
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>Tooltips</code> are enabled in this example. To see a tooltip in action, hover over or tap on the chart.

    <p style="font-weight: 500"><b>Injecting Module</b></p>
    <p>
        Chart component features are segregated into individual feature-wise modules. To use spline series, we need to
        inject
        <code>SplineSeries</code> module using <code>Chart.Inject(SplineSeries)</code> method.
    </p>
    <p>
        More information on the spline series can be found in this
