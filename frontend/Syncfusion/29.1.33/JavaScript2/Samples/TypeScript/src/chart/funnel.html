        In this example, you can see how to render and configure a funnel chart to visualize the recruitment process. The <code>trapezoidal</code> funnelMode is set to display the stages of the employment cycle, from the number of candidates who applied to the number of hires. The labels are smartly arranged to avoid overlapping.

    <p>
        chart component features are segregated into individual feature-wise modules. To use Funnel series, we need to inject
        <code>FunnelSeries</code> module using <code>AccumulationChart.Inject(FunnelSeries)</code> method.
    </p>

        More information on the funnel series can be found in this
