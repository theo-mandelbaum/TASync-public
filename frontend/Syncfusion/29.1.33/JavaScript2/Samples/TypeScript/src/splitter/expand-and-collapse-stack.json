With Neural Networks Using C# Succinctly<sup>®</sup> by James McCaffrey, you’ll learn \n                    how to create your own neural network to solve classification problems, or problems where the outcomes can only be one of \n                    several values. <br><br>Learn about encoding and normalizing data, activation functions and how to choose the right one, and ultimately \n                    how to train a neural network to find weights and bias values that provide accurate predictions.\n                    An artificial neural network (sometimes abbreviated ANN, or shortened to just \"neural network\" when the context is clear) is \n                    a software system that loosely models biological neurons and synapses. Before explaining exactly how neural networks work, it is \n                    useful to understand what types of problems they can solve.\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    <div id=\"verticalSplitter\">\n            <div>\n                <div class=\"expand-content\">\n                    <a href=\"https://www.syncfusion.com/ebooks/data_capture_and_extraction_with_c_sharp_succinctly\" target=\"_blank\">Data Capture and Extraction with C# Succinctly<sup>®</sup></a>\n                    <p>Capturing and extracting information is one of the most important tasks a developer can perform, and making this task more\n                        engaging without relying entirely on specialized tools is an efficient way to improve productivity.\n                        In Data Capture and Extraction with C# Succinctly<sup>®</sup>, author Ed Freitas guides readers toward getting more out of C# in minimal time.\n                        Email has become a pillar of our modern and connected society, and it now serves as a primary means of communication.
