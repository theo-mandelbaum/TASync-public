    <p>This sample demonstrates how to utilize the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/ftp-aspcore-file-provider">File Transfer Protocol file system provider</a> to manage the files in the File Manager control.
            To run the service, create a FTP connection, and then configure the FTP details such as <i><b>host name</b></i>, <i><b>user name</b></i>, and <i><b>password</b></i> in the <code>SetFTPConnection</code> method to perform the file operations.</p>

<div id="description">
    <p>The File Manager control is used to explore a file system through a web application, similar to the Windows Explorer for Windows. It supports all the basic file operations such as create, rename, delete, and more.</p>

    <b>Note: </b>File Manager's upload functionality is restricted in online demos for security reasons. To work with upload functionality, please download <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/ftp-aspcore-file-provider">ftp-aspcore-file-provider</a> from the GitHub repository.
