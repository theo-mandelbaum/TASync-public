                This sample demonstrates how to create a direction compass by modifying the circular gauge's functionalities
                to
                meet the needs of the user.

            <p>
                In this example, a direction compass has been depicted by adding a couple of needle pointers in the circular
                gauge and customizing labels to show the direction.
