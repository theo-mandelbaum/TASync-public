        This sample displays the browser market share using a 3D pie chart with selection and highlight behavior.

    <p>
        In this sample, you can select and highlight any point in the chart by clicking on or touching it. Additionally,
        you have the option to select and highlight a point during the initial loading of the chart using the
        <code>selectedDataIndexes</code> option.
    </p>
    <p><code>Tooltip</code> is enabled in this example. To see the tooltip in action, hover over a point or tap on a
        point on touch-enabled devices.</p>

    <p>
        3D circular chart component features are segregated into individual feature-wise modules. To use selection, you
        need to inject the
        <code>CircularChartSelection3D</code> module using <code>CircularChart3D.Inject(CircularChartSelection3D)</code>
        method.
