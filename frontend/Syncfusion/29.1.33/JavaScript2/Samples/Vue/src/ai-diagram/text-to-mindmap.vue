            <p>This demo sample showcases the creation of a dynamic mindmap diagram using the Vue Diagram control with
        the assistance of AI. The AI-powered diagram features nodes and connectors arranged in a mindmap layout, designed to
        visually organize and represent ideas and concepts. This sample is ideal for brainstorming, organizing thoughts,
        and visually mapping out complex information. The context menu allows for quick actions such as adding, editing,
        or deleting nodes, making it a powerful tool for interactively managing and expanding mindmaps.

        This sample leverages a specialized AI prompt, allowing users to generate the content of the diagram by
        submitting a prompt to OpenAI. The AI's response is parsed and transformed into nodes and connectors, visually
        representing the generated ideas or concepts in a mindmap format. Users can also manually add child nodes using
        user handles to further expand and customize the mindmap, creating an interactive and personalized experience.
