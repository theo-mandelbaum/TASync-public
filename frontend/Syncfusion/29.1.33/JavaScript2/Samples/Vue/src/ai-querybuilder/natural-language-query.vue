        Natural Language Querying in the Query Builder allows users to construct complex queries using plain, everyday
        language. Instead of relying on technical query syntax, users can simply type their questions or requests as
        they would naturally speak them. This feature interprets the intent and generates the corresponding query,
        making data retrieval more accessible to non-technical users.

        The Natural Language Querying feature enables users to input queries in plain language, which the system then
        interprets to automatically generate the appropriate database queries. This simplifies the process of data
        retrieval, allowing users to obtain insights without needing to understand complex query syntax.
