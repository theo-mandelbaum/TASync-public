                This demo illustrates the creation of a flowchart diagram using the Vue Diagram control with the
                assistance
                of AI. The AI-powered flowchart is structured with nodes and connectors arranged in a flowchart layout,
                designed
                to visually represent processes and workflows. This sample is particularly effective for visualizing
                step-by-step procedures, workflows, and decision-making paths in a clear and interactive manner.

                This sample leverages a specialized AI prompt to create a dynamic flowchart diagram by submitting a
                request to
                OpenAI. The AI-generated response is parsed to produce nodes and connectors arranged in a flowchart
                layout,
                visually representing the defined processes or workflows. Users can generate and visualize the flowchart
                content
                based on their input prompt, creating an interactive and organized depiction of processes and
                decision-making
                paths.
