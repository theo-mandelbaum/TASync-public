<div id="description">
    <p>This sample demonstrates the <code>Import/Export</code> feature of the Rich Text Editor, which allows users to import the Word document into the editor. The word document can be imported as Rich Text Editor content by clicking the import to Word icon, browsing for the document, and uploading it to the server, where it is converted to HTML and then sent to the Rich Text Editor as its value.</p>
    <p><b>Injecting the ImportExport Module</b></p>
    <p>The <code>ImportExport</code> feature is provided as an injectable module. To use it, inject the module using the
        following code:</p>
    <code>RichTextEditor.Inject(Toolbar, Link, Image, HtmlEditor, QuickToolbar, ImportExport);</code>
