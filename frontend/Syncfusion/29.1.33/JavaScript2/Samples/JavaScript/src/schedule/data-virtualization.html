        This example demonstrates the dynamic retrieval of events on each scroll within the Scheduler.
        As the content is scrolled, a data-loading request is dispatched to a remote data server.
        This request specifically aims to load appointments only for the resources currently being displayed.

        In this example, the lazy loading option is enabled in timeline month and month views to load 1000 resources, and data from remote service is bound to the Scheduler
        using the instance of <code><a aria-label="Data Manager" target="_blank" class="code" href="http://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/data/api-dataManager.html">DataManager</a></code>.
        To enable the on-demand loading of events in the Scheduler, set the <code>enableLazyLoading</code> property to <code>true</code> within the view-specific settings.
