        This demo illustrates how to add and remove holiday events and perform CRUD operations on holiday dates in the
        Scheduler.

        This sample demonstrates how to perform CRUD operations on holiday dates in a calendar. If a user wants to
        schedule an appointment on a holiday, they should check the <code>Scheduling event on holiday</code> checkbox.
        This will enable them to add an appointment on a holiday date.If a holiday list is displayed in the calendar, the
        <code>Holiday events</code> checkbox will be checked. The holiday list is highlighted in a different color.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            When an action is performed to drag and resize an event, if the <code>Scheduling event on holiday</code>
            checkbox is checked, the appointment can be scheduled on holiday dates. If it is unchecked, the appointment
            cannot have CRUD actions performed on it, and a warning message will be displayed.
        </li>
        <li>If a recurring event is added on a holiday date and the <code>Scheduling event on holiday</code> checkbox is
            checked, it allows the event to occur on that dates. If the checkbox is unchecked, it prevents the event from
            occurring, based on the dates in the holiday collection.
        </li>
    </ul>
