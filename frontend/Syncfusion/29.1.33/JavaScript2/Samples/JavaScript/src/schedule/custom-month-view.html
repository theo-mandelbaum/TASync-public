        In this demo, the starting week of the month view is customized by using the <code>displayDate</code>
        property. The number of weeks rendered in a month is customized by using the <code>numberOfWeeks</code>
        property and the maximum number of events displayed in a single row is customized by using the
        <code>maxEventsPerRow</code> property. These properties have been configured under the <code>views</code>
        property view options. <code>displayDate</code> and <code>numberOfWeeks</code> properties can be applicable only
        for month view. The <code>maxEventsPerRow</code> property is only applicable for month, timeline, and timeline
        year views.
