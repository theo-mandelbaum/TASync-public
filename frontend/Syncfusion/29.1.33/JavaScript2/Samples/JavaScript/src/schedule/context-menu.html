        This example illustrates how to enable the context menu on Scheduler and perform its related actions based on
        the selected menu options.

        In this example, we have integrated the ContextMenu control separately from application end and set its target
        to Scheduler control. Also, we have used the public methods <code>openEditor</code> through which the default
        event editor is set to open for saving or updating the appointments, <code>deleteEvent</code> to delete the
        selected appointment, and <code>selectedDate</code> to navigate to today's date. In mobile devices, the
        context menu will open when you tap hold on the cells or events.
