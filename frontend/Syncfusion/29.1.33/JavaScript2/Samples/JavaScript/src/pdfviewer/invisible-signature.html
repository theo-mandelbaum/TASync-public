    <p>This sample demonstrates how to digitally sign a PDF document from code behind using Syncfusion's PDF Viewer and
        PDF Library</p>
</div>

<div id="description">
    <p>
        This sample operates correctly when a signature field is present in the PDF document. If all signature fields
        are signed, the "Finish Signing" button becomes enabled. Clicking this button adds a digital signature
        certificate programmatically and reloads the digitally signed document into the viewer.
    </p>

    <br />

    <p>The below are the messages shown in the respective scenarios:</p>

    <br />

    <p>1. The document has been digitally signed, but it has been modified since it was signed and at least one
        signature is invalid.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>This message appears if the digitally signed document is edited after reloading.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>2. The document has been digitally signed and at least one signature has a problem.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>This message is shown if the digital signature is not registered on the machine and is not in the trusted
            list. Adding the certificate to the trusted list is necessary.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>3. The document has been digitally signed and all the signatures are valid.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>This message indicates that the document is digitally signed without any issues.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
