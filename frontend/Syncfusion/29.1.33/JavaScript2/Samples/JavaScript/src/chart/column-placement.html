        In this example, you can see how to render and configure the column chart. The column chart is used to compare the frequency, count, total, or average of data in different categories. The <code>EnableSideBySidePlacement</code> property is used to enable and disable side-by-side positioning. DataLabel is used to present details about individual data points.
    </p>

        Tooltip is enabled in this example. To see the tooltip in action, hover over a point or tap on a point in touch-enabled devices.
