    <p>In this example, you can see how to render and configure a donut chart that displays the average stock market
        prices of leading tech giants, with each entry featuring the company name and corresponding stock price. The
        donut chart updates dynamically using the
        <code>setData</code> method to show the progression of stock prices from 2010 to 2020.
