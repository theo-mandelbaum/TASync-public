        This example demonstrates the global smartphone sales trends by brand from 2021 to 2023 using a bar chart. The
        data is visualized with bars representing unit sales for different brands, highlighting the comparative
        performance of each brand over the years.

        In this example, you can see how to render and configure the bar chart. The bar chart is similar to the column
        chart, but the orientation of the y-axis is horizontal rather than vertical.

        <code>Tooltips</code> are enabled in this example. To see the tooltip in action, hover over a point or tap on a
