        In this example, you can see how to render and configure the histogram chart. The histogram chart is a bar (column) chart used for frequency distribution in which the widths of the bars are proportional to classes into which variables have been divided and the heights of the bars are proportional to class frequencies. The <code>DataLabel</code> property is used to present details on individual data points.
