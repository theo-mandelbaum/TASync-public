        In this example, you can see how to render and configure the stacked bar chart. The stacked bar chart stacks points
        in the series horizontally. You can also use the <code>stackingGroup</code> property to group stacked collections
        based on category.
    </p>

        <code>Tooltips</code> are enabled in this example. To see the tooltip in action, hover over a point or tap on a
        point in touch-enabled devices.
