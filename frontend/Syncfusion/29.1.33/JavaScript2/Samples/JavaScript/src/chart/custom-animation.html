        This sample visualizes the almond yield per hectare data for different countries using a spline series in the chart. 
        The data points are enhanced with tooltip and the animation delay is configured to provide a smooth, staggered effect.

        In this example, you can see how to render and configure a spline chart with multiple series representing almond yield across different countries over time. Spline charts are ideal for visualizing smooth trends in data over equal intervals, particularly time-dependent data.
        The <code>width</code> and <code>animation</code> properties are used to customize the appearance and behavior of the spline. The staggered animations enhance the visual experience by introducing each spline in sequence.

        <code>Tooltips</code> are enabled in this example. To see a tooltip in action, hover over or tap on the chart.
