    <p>This sample demonstrates the Grid component with the column spanning feature. In this sample, you will see multiple columns spanning.
    </p>

        This feature enables you to span multiple adjacent cells. Use the <code>colSpan</code> attribute to define how many cells are to be spanned in the <a aria-label="API link for documentation" href='https://ej2.syncfusion.com/javascript/documentation/api/grid/queryCellInfoEventArgs/'><code>QueryCellInfo</code></a> event. 
        Additionally, you can freeze columns at specific positions by setting the freeze property to left, right, center and fixed in the column definition.
</p>
    <p>
        In this demo, you can see that the employee named <b>Davolio</b> is analyzing data from 9.00 AM to 10.00 AM, so the cells for that time are spanned. Similarly, another employee <b>Buchanan</b> is doing support work from 9.30 AM to 11.00 AM, and the cells are spanned accordingly. 
        Also, the <b>Employee ID</b> column is frozen to the left.
