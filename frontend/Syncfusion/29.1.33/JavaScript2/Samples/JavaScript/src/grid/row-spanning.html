    This feature enables you to span multiple adjacent cells. Use the <code>rowSpan</code> attribute to define how many cells are to be spanned in the <a aria-label="API link for documentation" href='https://ej2.syncfusion.com/javascript/documentation/api/grid/queryCellInfoEventArgs/'><code>QueryCellInfo</code></a> event. 
    Additionally, you can freeze columns at specific positions by setting the freeze property to left, right, center and fixed in the column definition.
</p>
<p>
    In this demo, you can see that the <b>Davolio</b> cell is spanned to two rows in the employee named column. Similarly, the <b>Lunch Break</b> cell is spanned to ten rows and three columns in the 1:00 column. 
    Also, the <b>Employee ID</b> column is frozen to the left.
