        In this example, you can see how to render a 3D donut chart with varying radii. You can use the
        <code>radius</code> mapping property to achieve this feature. The data labels are used to represent individual
        data and its values. In addition, the sample shows how to change the order of legend for the donut
        chart by using the <code>reverse</code> property.

    <p><code>Tooltip</code> is enabled in this example. To see the tooltip in action, hover over a point or tap on a
        point on touch-enabled devices.</p>
