        In this example, you can see how to render and configure a 3D pie chart. The pie chart is a circular graphic,
        which is ideal for displaying categories as a proportion or a percentage of the whole.
        The radius of the pie chart can be customized using the <code>radius</code> property. You can rotate and tilt
        the pie chart using a mouse or touch-enabled devices.
    </p>
    <p><code>Tooltip</code> is enabled in this example. To see the tooltip in action, hover over a point or tap on a
        point on touch-enabled devices.</p>
