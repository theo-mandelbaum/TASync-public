    <p> In this example, you can see how to render and configure a 3D donut chart. The donut chart is a circular
        graphic, which is ideal for displaying categories as a proportion or a percentage of the whole. To create a
        donut in the pie series, use the <code>innerRadius</code> property. You can rotate and tilt the donut chart
        using a mouse or
        touch-enabled devices.</p>
    <p><code>Tooltip</code> is enabled in this example. To see the tooltip in action, hover over a point or tap on a
        point on touch-enabled devices.</p>
