    <ul>
        <li><strong>Content Summary:</strong> Users can quickly get summaries of .txt, .pdf, and .docx files by
            selecting a file and clicking the "Quick Summary" button in the File Manager Toolbar.</li>
        <li><strong>AI Tagging:</strong> Users can tag files with AI-generated tag details by selecting a file and
            clicking the "Manage Tags" button in the File Manager context menu.</li>
        <li><strong>Tag Search:</strong> Users can search for items based on file tags. By providing a file tag in the
            File Manager search bar and clicking the search icon, users can find files tagged with the specified term.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>These features enhance file management by making document overview faster and making it easier to categorize and
        locate files based on their tags.</p>
