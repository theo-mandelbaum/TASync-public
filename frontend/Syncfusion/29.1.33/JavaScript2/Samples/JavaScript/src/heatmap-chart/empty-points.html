            can be marked using <code>null</code> in the data source. You can also customize the background color of the
            empty points by using the <a href="https://ej2.syncfusion.com/javascript/documentation/api/heatmap/paletteSettingsModel/#emptypointcolor" target='_blank'>emptyPointColor</a> property in <a href="https://ej2.syncfusion.com/javascript/documentation/api/heatmap/paletteSettingsModel/" target='_blank'>paletteSettings</a>
