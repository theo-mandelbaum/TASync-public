            In this example, you can see how to switch the Heatmap to canvas rendering mode.The rendering performance will be better in <code>Canvas</code> rendering mode, while loading large datasets. You can switch the rendering mode for Heatmap between <code>SVG</code> and <code>Canvas</code> using the <a href="https://ej2.syncfusion.com/javascript/documentation/heatmap-chart/rendering-mode" target="_blank">renderingMode </a> property. When the <code>renderingMode </code> property is set to <code>Auto</code>, the rendering mode will be switched automatically based of the size of data source to improve the rendering performance.

        <p>The tooltip is enabled in this example. To see the tooltip in action, hover the mouse over an item or tap an item on touch-enabled devices.</p>
