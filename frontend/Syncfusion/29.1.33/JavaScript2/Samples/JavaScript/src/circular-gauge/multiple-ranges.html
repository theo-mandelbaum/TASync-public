            This sample shows temperature variations in a circular gauge using multiple ranges. In addition, the needle
            pointer and annotation help in displaying the temperature that has been measured.

            In this example, you can see how to render and configure multiple ranges in the circular gauge. The <a

            collection
            can be used to define multiple ranges, each of which points to a different start and end value.
